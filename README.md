# 🔐 Task-01: Caesar Cipher
**Prodigy Infotech | Cyber Security Internship**  
**Track Code:** `PRODIGY_CS_01`  
**Task Title:** Implement Caesar Cipher

---

## 📌 Objective
Build a Python program that implements the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm to allow users to:
- Encrypt a message using a shift value
- Decrypt a message using the same shift value

---

## 💡 About Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:
- `A` becomes `D`
- `B` becomes `E`
- ...
- `Z` becomes `C`

---

## 🛠️ Features
- Accepts user input for the message and shift value
- Supports both encryption and decryption
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Leaves non-alphabetic characters (like numbers and symbols) unchanged

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `PRODIGY_CS_01.py` – Main Python script implementing the Caesar Cipher
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## 🚀 How to Run
### ▶️ Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed

### ▶️ Run the Program:
```bash
python PRODIGY_CS_01.py
